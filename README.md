# Sidescroller

## Sidescrolling & snapping CSS tests.


Test of horizontally scrolling/snapping 'slides' inside a group of vertically scrolling/snapping 'pages'.

The question I was trying to answer here is, can you still scroll up and down inside a fullscreen div once you have a fullscreen div inside it that scrolls side-to-side. The answer is yes!

In fact, it seems to work really well!
